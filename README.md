Description:  
We will be designing a crowd-sourced rating web application that will allow users with a valid SJSU ID to rate and vote on various items. Users will be able to create their own polls and questions regarding anything from courses to restaurants to events, and other users will be able to anonymously interact with these polls/questions and see how their peers interact with those polls/questions. Users will also be able to search for topics they are interested in.
